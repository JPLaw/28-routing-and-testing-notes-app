===
Welcome to my To Do App!

On this App, you can add a task to your "to do list" that includes a name for the task and some details if you would like to add some. By pressing "Create Note", you can save your task to your dashboard. Once the task is completed, simply click on the "Remove Note" button to check that off your list. Feels good to check those off, right?
